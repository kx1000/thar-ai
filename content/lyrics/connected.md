We're not alone, we've never been, no!\
Stars long gone, beneath our skin\
We are one, everything is\
Conscious or not, you exist

Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus\
Potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron

Come friend, look around\
You are a part of it\
Same blocks, same design\
You’re not as special as you think\
Come friend, look around\
We are a part of it\
Same blood, same desires\
We're not so different, you and me\
Not so different at all, no!

All you've ever had, all you've ever seen, all the things around you are related to each other\
Everything that's yours, everything that's not, everything that's here is a part of greater order\
Far beyond our grasp, much too grand for us to fathom\
Far beyond our grasp, far beyond our understanding

Come friend, look around\
You are a part of it\
Same blocks, same design\
You’re not as special as you think\
Come friend, look around\
We are a part of it\
Same blood, same desires\
We're not so different, you and me

Connected\
To the stars up high, to the ground below\
To the things we crave, to the things we own\
To the life we give, to the death we cause\
To the ones we hate, to the ones we love

Come friend, look around\
You are a part of it\
Connected to the world\
With bonds you cannot break

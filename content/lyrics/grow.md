Sitting all alone on this pale blue dot\
Thinking many thoughts\
Still covered in shit \
Opposing thumbs so quick to grab the lowest hanging fruit

A speck of dust on a little piece of rock\
A self-proclaimed ruler of the world\
So fragile and so tedious\
All the gods will not save you from yourself

In the grand scheme of things\
You're nothing\
In the grand scheme of things\
You're everything as well

So ignorant\
So self-indulged\
Are you the cure?\
Are you the cause?\
Killing all that lives just because you can\
Will you ever learn - to give more than you take?\
To live in peace with everything else?

A speck of dust on a little piece of rock\
A self-proclaimed ruler of the world\
No limits to your greediness\
Wishful thinking will not save you from yourself

In the grand scheme of things\
You're nothing\
In the grand scheme of things\
You're everything as well

What if I challenged you to be a little more with every breath\
To grow and think, to try and help\
To care and see, become what you can be

A speck of dust on a little piece of rock\
A self-proclaimed ruler of the world\
Too fucking dumb to realize\
A little prayer will not save you from yourself

In the grand scheme of things\
You're nothing\
In the grand scheme of things\
You're everything as well

Grow!

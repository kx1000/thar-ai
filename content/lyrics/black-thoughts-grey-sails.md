Sailing with no aim but to reach the bottom
Waves washing away whatever doubt I had left

Grey sails adorning my ship - they lost all the colours they had - they'll never be whole again

Carrying all the gifts of regret I have been given
Sinking in all these thoughts of contempt I am feeling
Questioning every choice, every step I have taken
Shouting loud, trusting that every word makes it better

Slowly losing my voice
I scream my lungs out
Slowly losing control
Nothing seems to work, nothing seems to work, no!

Grey sails adorning my ship - they lost all the colours they had - they'll never be whole again, but none of it matters now
Black thoughts controlling my head - they snuck in and stayed here for good - I'll never be free again

I know I'm not the only one
I know you're sailing just the same
I saw it deep within your eyes
I saw you're breaking just like me

No steer, no aim
You're just the same
Black thoughts, grey sails
You're just the same
You're just like me

I know I'm not the only one
I know you're sailing just the same
I saw it deep within your eyes
I saw you're breaking

Grey sails adorning my ship - they lost all the colours they had - they'll never be whole again, but none of it matters now
Black thoughts controlling my head - they snuck in and stayed here for good - I'll never be what I once used to be

Throw me a bone and forget that I’m even there\
Then throw a stone cause I looked at you the wrong way\
Look at this chain - it’s too short, it’s hurting my neck\
I doubt that you even care

Not my friend\
How would I know what a friend is?

Let me go, allow me to breathe\
Just for a moment please\
Take it off, it won’t let me breathe\
This chain is not a part of me

I understand more than what you think\
I am aware, I live, I feel\
I fear your touch, yet I long it so\
If only you could know

Contrary to your belief - I am aware\
Contrary to your belief - I live, I feel\
Contrary to your belief - I deserve the right to live decently\
It’s not too much to ask for, is it?

Not my friend\
How would I know what a friend is?

Let me go, allow me to breathe\
Just for a moment please\
Take it off, it won’t let me breathe\
This chain is not a part of me

Perhaps one day you will see me the way you should from the start\
Perhaps that day you will free me and prove you do have a heart\
Till then I’ll carry on feeling alone and empty inside\
I’ll wait and carry on living my sad excuse for a life

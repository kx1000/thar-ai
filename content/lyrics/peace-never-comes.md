All those who worshipped you are gone\
An old god in a castle of glass\
Alone - just waiting for deliverance\
Afraid - just waiting for your time

Yet peace never comes\
Yet peace never comes\
Yet peace never comes\
Yet death never comes\
For you

Hate brings hate\
Hell brings hell\
Scorn brings scorn\
Pain brings pain

All those you cherished are long gone\
A sad man in a prison of hate\
Alone - just waiting for deliverance\
Afraid - just waiting for your time

Yet peace never comes\
Yet peace never comes\
Yet peace never comes\
Yet death never comes\
For you

Hate brought hate\
Hell brought hell\
Scorn brought scorn\
Pain brought pain

Come!\
Come!\
Come!\
Come!

Est quaedam flere voluptas\
Est quaedam flere voluptas\
Est quaedam flere voluptas\
Est quaedam flere voluptas

I suppose I made it this far - how difficult could it be to keep on breathing, to carry on being me?

Connected, yet afar\
Living, yet longing to die - is this what it's supposed to be like?\
More broken, less divine\
Breathing, but too weak to smile - this cannot be right...

Floating high - comfortably numb - am I dead or alive?\
Crawling low - desperately lost - am I real or am I not?

Awake or still dreaming, complete or in pieces, up high or down low\
The lines start to blur\
Still me or not really, away or right here, right now or much later\
Is there a difference anymore?

I pinch my finger\
The buzzing won't stop, the static grows, overwhelming every part of me\
I pinch it harder\
The buzzing gets worse, the static roars, overtaking every particle inside of me

Then you came in - you were ideal\
Like it was nothing - you made me real\
All these doubts - they disappeared\
All my thoughts - became so clear

Now I know - now I see\
You're the difference

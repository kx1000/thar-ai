Don't curse the darkness, become the light yourself\
Get up and chase away all the fears that weigh down your chest\
See the world for what it is and not for what it seems to be\
Make peace with yourself - that's where it all begins - I'll tell you when you're done

Let yourself dream of better things\
Let yourself become what you can be

That grain of hope, all on its own - without your help is doomed to rot\
A little kiss, a loving touch - it's all it needs, it's all you've got

I know the words that pulled you down\
I know the doubt, uncertainty\
I know your nightmares never cease\
Trust me they're not real

Let yourself dream of better things\
Let yourself become what you can be

That bud of pride, so beautiful - can grow much stronger if you want\
A little kiss, a loving touch - it's all it needs, it's all you've got

I know the pain you hide inside\
I know your face is ever still\
I know your visions never stop\
Soon theyâ€™ll disappear

Drag the phoenix right out of the ash if you must\
Drag the phoenix right out of the ash if you must\
Drag the phoenix right out of the ash if you must\
Drag the phoenix right out of the ash, it's so easy if you... try

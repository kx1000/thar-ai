I know I'm not the only one\
I know you're sailing just the same\
I saw it deep within your eyes\
I saw you're breaking

Youâ€™re just the same

Grey sails adorning my ship\
Black thoughts controlling my head

No steer, no aim\
You're just the same\
Black thoughts, grey sails\
You're just the same\
You're just like me

You're just like me

Lyrics: Patryk "Pat"\
Remix: Patryk "Pat"

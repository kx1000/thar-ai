Come, have you seen how great I’m doing?\
I only broke the world a bit\
Here, take a look - it’s barely burning\
I think I killed much less than you\
Tell me my kin - tell me I win\
I might be flesh of your own flesh, but I’m the best

Human - Superb - Ruler - I’m - Human - Superb - Ruler - of\
All - the land and the sea\
All - cause all I lay my hands on is mine

You must be proud, I am so perfect\
I’m clearly better than the rest \[I know I am]\
A gracious king, a faithful servant\
All I have done was in your name \[I would again]\
Tell me my God - tell me I’m good\
For am I mind of your own mind, the chosen kind

Human - Superb - Ruler - I'm - Human - Superb - Ruler - of\
All - the land and the sea\
All - cause all I lay my hands on is mine\
All - the dead and the living\
All - no boundaries limiting what is mine

This is mine\
That is mine too\
All is mine

Mine

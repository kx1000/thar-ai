Hail, hail, hail the Plastic Kings\
Oh, blessed be their name\
Their plastic legacy is here to stay\
It's floating in the sea - it's flowing in our veins, forever

Their kingdom - boundless, drenched in fear\
Can you hear - it's crying, crying, crying...\
Poisoned, hollowed, scarred and ripped and drowning in debris\
It's dying

Listen! Shut up and listen to its call\
Listen! Or would you rather see it fall - forever?

It's too late - glaciers, tears on my face, dripping down, melting away, so...\
Poisoned, hollowed, now my body's dying all the same\
I'm dying all the same

Hail, hail, hail the Plastic Kings\
Oh, blessed be their name\
Their plastic legacy is here to stay\
It's floating in the sea - it's flowing in our veins, forever

All hail the kings

Blood is the crop we harvest - do you think your hands are clean?\
Plastic is our gift - do you think it's well received?

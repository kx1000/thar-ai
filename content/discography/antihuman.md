'Antihuman' - the group's first LP was released in July 2021. It criticises the impact of humans on their environment, ranging from global problems, such as the excess plastic and environmental pollution in 'Plastic Kings', animal abuse in 'Man's Best Friend', or greed in 'Mine'. The album is not devoid of hope, however, as songs such as 'Grow' and 'Phoenix' encourage change, action, and growth. On the other end of the spectrum, a more personal approach is seen in, for instance, 'The Difference,' and 'Black Thoughts, Gray Sails' - a song in two contrasting versions which begin and conclude the album.
